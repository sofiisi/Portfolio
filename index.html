                          <p class="mb-5">
                            I design a box that could fit and show the camera and two LEDs. Initially, I wanted to solder the wires and part to better resistance, but I want to re-utilize LEDs and board in future projects, so I used jumper wires and a breadboard. The hardware is pretty simple; I had the microcontroller connected to two LEDs and an FTDI programmer for the computer connection. I just followed the tutorial instructions for connection and then added the lights.
                          </p>
                          <p>                            
                            I want to clarify that right now, the machine works just when I press a button, but I don’t know how to fix it yet. I believe it’s not a code problem, but it might be the weak WIFI or that the microcontroller is not powerful in off to stream the video and get the result simultaneously. I will keep working to figure out what it is and how I can improve it.

                          <p class="mb-5">
                           As I mentioned in the video, I asked for help to get reference data. With more than 30 people participating, I used teachable machine to create my model.
                          </p>
                          <p>                            
                            The first thing that I did was to take the ESP32-CAM example and modified to be just one code. In the beginning, it had the HTML parsed into another file. So I parsed back to HTML and put it all in just one code. Then I eliminated some stuff I didn't need to simplify the program. When I had a stream, I edit the JavaScript to add the model. What I did was took the process of teachable machine example but changed it to use the stream camera instead of the webcam. I create a function to print the data and decide which class is more probable. With that data, I add an upload function to update the firebase. After that, I came back to the raw Arduino, where I set up the connection with the database and create a code that reads the data and turns on the green LED if the person is using the face mas or the red LED if it's not.

                            My next project doesn't involve any electronics. With my friends, we really enjoy playing board games, especially Settlers of Catan, so I 3d print and hand paint the hole base game. I made some extras like the longest road reward. Now I'm working on creating our cards. I didn’t design the pieces I collect them from different makers. I modified some of the to fit better. What I learned with this project was to 3D print, this was my first big project in my own printer, so I had to figure out leveling and how to prevent lifting. In the pictures I show some of the failures.

                            I used fusion 360 to design a lamp with a thread system to connect to the base for easy access to the circuit. The top of the lamp was created to fit perfectly in the cylinder; I end up gluing that parts together. I designed the cylinder to be as thin as it could be at the same time keeping the clouds in shape. All was 3D printed on an Ender 3 pro with PLA.

                          <p class="mb-5">
                          For the code, I create a website with three sliders, each corresponding to the RGB colors. What the JavaScript does is to assign a number between 0 and 255 to a position in the slider or vice versa. The RGB color is displayed at the top of the website, so I can see which color is before sending it. The number is a string, but the Arduino needs an int. Therefore, before updating the data to the database, I convert the string into an int with parse. I also include a button to turned off. I used Firebase as my database. Here I’m going to include just the Arduino and the JavaScript because are the two most important; for more specification reefer to my GitHub in the Portfolio repository.
